# eTorii
Enhanced Torii (eTorii), a distributed, multiaddress and fault-tolerant layer two network fabric protocol
```eTorii = eGA3 + Torii```

## eGA3
#### Simulator of the eGA3 address assignment implemented in Python
##### About
#
   * the simulator executes the protocol eTorii on all hierarchical topologies located in the directory you are told , likewise these topologies must have the following format:
    - $topJAC <- always
    - duplex-link 
    - Source:
      - always Switch: $n("Hier_src"s"Pos_src"): where Hier_src is de source level and Pos_src is the position on the level f.e = $n(0s0)
    - Destination
      - For switch: $n("Hier_dst"s"Pos_dst"): where Hier_dst is de destination level and Pos_des is the position on the level f.e = $n(1s7)
      - For host: $n(h"num_host): where h indicate host and num_host is de number of host f.e; $n(h155)
   * The result are all of HLMAC asignates for all nodes

##### Use
#
```sh
            ./etoriiAddressAssign.py
            Subdirectory name topologies:
```
#### Topology Builder
##### About
#
   * it generates as many as topolgies files that we want, it only need a several parameters: 
    - Number of Topologies.
    - Number of Hierarchical levels [nL: 2..9]:
    - Number of nodes at level-> X: 
    - Number of links down from level-> X:
    - Number of Host:
   * The result is several file, where we can found one topology per file

##### Use
#
```sh
            python genHierarchicalTopology.py   

            Builds arbitrary datacenter topologies:
                [1] Hierarchical
            
            Select[1, [0 to abort]]: 1 
            
            Builds T arbitrary hierarchical DC topologies of nL levels of switches,
            nLi nodes at level Li, lLi links between level Li and Li+1
            nH hosts (end systems) single connected to a nLth level switch
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Number of Topologies [nT: 1..100]: 
            Number of Hierarchical levels [nL: 2..9]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 0 [nL0: 1..1000]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 1 [nL1: 1..1000]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 2 [nL2: 1..1000]: 
            Number of links down from level-> 0 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
            Number of links down from level-> 1 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
            Number of links down from level-> 2 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
```
#### Painter Topologies
##### About
#
   * it gets from a file topologies generated by the generator above a description of the topology , giving it two parameters: 
    - Nodes are represented by circles.
    - Links : represented by lines ranging from a source node to a destination node
   * The result is four files: a PNG , a PDF, EPS and SGV , all with the representation of the topology

##### Use
#
```sh
            python pintar_topologia.py 
```
