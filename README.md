# eTorii
Enhanced Torii (eTorii), a distributed, multiaddress and fault-tolerant layer two network fabric protocol
```eTorii = eGA3 + Torii```

## eGA3
#### Simulator of the eGA3 address assignment implemented in Python

#### Generador de topologias para el Simulador
##### About
#
   * it generates as many as topolgies files that we want, it only need a several parameters: 
    - Number of Topologies.
    - Number of Hierarchical levels [nL: 2..9]:
    - Number of nodes at level-> X: 
    - Number of links down from level-> X:
    - Number of Host:
   * The result is several file, where we can found one topology per file

##### Use
#
```sh
            python genHierarchicalTopology.py   

            Builds arbitrary datacenter topologies:
                [1] Hierarchical
            
            Select[1, [0 to abort]]: 1 
            
            Builds T arbitrary hierarchical DC topologies of nL levels of switches,
            nLi nodes at level Li, lLi links between level Li and Li+1
            nH hosts (end systems) single connected to a nLth level switch
            -----------------------------------------------------------------------
            Number of Topologies [nT: 1..100]: 
            Number of Hierarchical levels [nL: 2..9]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 0 [nL0: 1..1000]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 1 [nL1: 1..1000]: 
            Number of nodes at level-> 2 [nL2: 1..1000]: 
            Number of links down from level-> 0 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
            Number of links down from level-> 1 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
            Number of links down from level-> 2 [dlL0: 16..2000]:
```
#### Painter Topologies
##### About
#
   * it gets from a file topologies generated by the generator above a description of the topology , giving it two parameters: 
    - Nodes are represented by circles.
    - Links : represented by lines ranging from a source node to a destination node
   * The result is four files: a PNG , a PDF, EPS and SGV , all with the representation of the topology

##### Use
#
```sh
            python pintar_topologia.py 
```
