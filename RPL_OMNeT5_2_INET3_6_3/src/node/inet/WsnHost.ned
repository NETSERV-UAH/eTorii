package wsn_rpl.node.inet; //EXTRA


//
// A wireless host containing routing, mobility and battery components.
// Supports only IPv4 protocol, TCP and UDP as transport protocol.
// This is a typical mobile node which can participate in adhoc routing
// and may have TCP/UDP applications installed. Supports ICMP (ping) too.
//
// - By default contains a single wireless cards, however it can be configured
//   by the numRadios parameter. Wireless card type is configured by the
//   **.wlan.typename parameter. see:  inet.linklayer.ieee80211 or other
//   modules implementing ~IWirelessNic
// - Node mobility can be set using **.mobility.typename
//   see: inet.mobility and ~IMobility
